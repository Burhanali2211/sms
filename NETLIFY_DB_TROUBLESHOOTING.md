# Netlify DB Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues encountered when setting up Netlify DB.

## Current Status

âœ… **Netlify DB is now properly configured!** The `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` environment variable has been successfully set in your Netlify project. Your application can now use the Netlify DB integration when deployed.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Failed to initialize DB: Internal server error"

This was a known issue that occurred when the Netlify DB service was experiencing temporary problems. Since your database URL is now properly configured, this issue should be resolved.

### 2. "connection string is not provided" error

This error occurs when the `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not set. Since your database URL is now properly configured, this issue should be resolved.

### 3. Drizzle migration issues

If you're using Drizzle ORM with Netlify DB, you might encounter migration issues.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Netlify's migration commands**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Run migrations in Netlify environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

## Alternative Setup Approach

If you continue to experience issues with Netlify DB, you can use the traditional PostgreSQL setup:

1. **Set up a PostgreSQL database** with your preferred provider (Render, Railway, etc.)

2. **Configure environment variables** in your Netlify site:
   ```
   VITE_PG_HOST=your-postgres-host
   VITE_PG_PORT=5432
   VITE_PG_DATABASE=your-database-name
   VITE_PG_USER=your-username
   VITE_PG_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

3. **The fallback solution** in this project will automatically use these variables when Netlify DB is not available.

## Testing Your Database Connection

To test your database connection with the fallback solution:

```bash
npm run test:db-fallback
```

To test the Netlify DB connection when deployed:

```bash
npm run test:netlify-db-connection
```

This script will test both Netlify DB (when available) and the traditional PostgreSQL connection.

## Manual Environment Variable Setup

Your environment variables are already configured:
```
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_fFsHqSLP3t5e@ep-calm-snow-ae5kr32z-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?channel_binding=require&sslmode=require
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_fFsHqSLP3t5e@ep-calm-snow-ae5kr32z-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?channel_binding=require&sslmode=require
```
