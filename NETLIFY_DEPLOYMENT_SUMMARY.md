## Package.json Updates

Added a new script:
```json
"deploy:netlify": "node deploy-to-netlify.js"
```

## Configuration Details

### Netlify.toml
The configuration file includes:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- SPA routing redirects to ensure all routes serve index.html
- Security headers for enhanced security
- Environment variable template for VITE_API_URL

### Environment Variables
For proper operation, you'll need to set:
- `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api`

## Deployment Process

1. **Build**: `npm run build` creates the production-ready files in the `dist` folder
2. **Login**: `netlify login` authenticates with your Netlify account
3. **Deploy**: `netlify deploy --prod` deploys the site to production
4. **Configure**: Set environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
5. **Redeploy**: Deploy again to apply environment variables

## Benefits of Netlify Deployment

1. **Automatic SSL**: Netlify provides free SSL certificates
2. **Global CDN**: Fast content delivery worldwide
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment on Git pushes
4. **Custom Domains**: Easy custom domain setup
5. **Analytics**: Built-in analytics and monitoring
6. **Free Tier**: Generous free tier for small to medium projects

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build Failures**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
2. **Routing Issues**: Check that the redirect rules in netlify.toml are correctly configured
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify that variables are set in the Netlify dashboard and prefixed with `VITE_`
4. **Asset Loading**: Ensure the base path in vite.config.ts is set to `/`

## Next Steps

1. Run the deployment script: `npm run deploy:netlify`
2. Follow the instructions to deploy to Netlify
3. Set your environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
4. Test your deployed application
