# EduSync Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes made to resolve deployment issues with the EduSync application on Render.

## Issues Identified

1. **WebSocket Connection Errors**: 
   - Error: `Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at wss://sms-kn5a.onrender.com/`
   - Root cause: Vite HMR (Hot Module Replacement) was enabled for production deployment

2. **MIME Type Errors**:
   - Error: `Loading module from ... was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type ("text/html")`
   - Root cause: Incorrect base path configuration causing assets to be served with wrong MIME types

3. **Module Loading Errors**:
   - Error: Browser trying to load files from `node_modules/.vite/deps/`
   - Root cause: Development build being deployed instead of production build

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Vite Configuration ([vite.config.ts](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/vite.config.ts))

- Changed `base: './'` to `base: '/'` for proper static hosting
- Disabled HMR for production by adding `hmr: false` to server configuration
- Kept proper asset optimization and chunking settings

### 2. HTML Base Tag ([index.html](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/index.html))

- Changed `<base href="./">` to `<base href="/">` to match Vite configuration
- Ensured proper asset loading paths

### 3. Render Configuration ([render.yaml](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/render.yaml))

- Fixed API URL from `edusync-backend-yg5g.onrender.com` to `edusync-backend.onrender.com`
- Ensured proper static site deployment settings

### 4. Build Verification Scripts

- Created [verify-build.js](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/verify-build.js) to verify build configuration
- Created [fix-deployment.js](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/fix-deployment.js) to automatically fix common deployment issues
- Created [ONLINE_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](file:///d:/ALL%20Data/eit_sms/ONLINE_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) with detailed deployment steps

### 5. Package.json Updates

- Added `verify:build` script for build verification
- Maintained all existing build scripts

## Verification Results

- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ✅ Dist folder contains all necessary assets
- ✅ Index.html properly configured with correct base path
- ✅ All JavaScript and CSS assets properly linked
- ✅ No development-specific files in build output

## Deployment Recommendations

1. Always use `npm run build` for production deployment, not `npm run dev`
2. Ensure HMR is disabled for static site deployments
3. Verify base path configuration matches between Vite config and HTML
4. Use the automated fix script before deployment: `node fix-deployment.js`
5. Verify build with: `npm run verify:build`

## Next Steps

1. Commit all changes to your repository
2. Redeploy your frontend service on Render
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Test all functionality including API connections and database operations

These fixes should resolve all the deployment issues and result in a fully functional EduSync application.
