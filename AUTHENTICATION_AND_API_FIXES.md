# Authentication and API Error Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Route Issues**: The login route was trying to access `first_name` and `last_name` fields that don't exist in the users table
2. **Missing Authentication Middleware**: Dashboard routes were missing authentication middleware
3. **Permission Issues**: Dashboard routes didn't verify user permissions properly
4. **API Client Issues**: The markNotificationRead function wasn't passing the required user ID
5. **Missing Sample Data**: Students and teachers tables were missing sample data needed for dashboard views
6. **Backend Route Logic**: The markNotificationAsRead route had incorrect logic

## Files Modified

### Backend Routes
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Fixed user data handling in login and register routes
- `backend/routes/dashboard.js` - Added authentication middleware and permission checks

### Frontend Components
- `src/utils/api/client.ts` - Updated markNotificationRead to accept user ID
- `src/hooks/use-dashboard-data.ts` - Updated to pass user ID to API calls
- `src/components/dashboard/FunctionalNotifications.tsx` - Updated to pass user ID
- `src/pages/dashboard/Notifications.tsx` - Updated to pass user ID

### Database
- `sql/02_insert_sample_data.sql` - Added sample data for students and teachers tables

## Root Cause Analysis

### Authentication Issues
The main authentication issue was in the [auth.js](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\backend\routes\auth.js) file where the login route was trying to access `first_name` and `last_name` fields that don't exist in the users table. The users table has a single [name](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\src\types\dashboard.ts#L28-L28) field instead.

### API Route Issues
The dashboard routes were missing authentication middleware, which meant they weren't verifying tokens before processing requests. This was causing 401 errors for authenticated users.

### Permission Issues
The dashboard routes weren't checking if users had permission to access notifications and events for other users, which could lead to security issues.

### Data Issues
The sample data didn't include entries in the students and teachers tables, which are required for the dashboard views to work properly.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Authentication Route Fix
Updated the login and register routes in [auth.js](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\backend\routes\auth.js) to properly handle the users table structure:
- Removed references to `first_name` and `last_name` fields
- Updated user data handling to work with the single [name](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\src\types\dashboard.ts#L28-L28) field

### 2. Dashboard Route Security
Added authentication middleware to all dashboard routes:
- Applied `authenticateToken` middleware to all routes
- Added permission checks to ensure users can only access their own data
- Updated the [markNotificationAsRead](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\src\hooks\use-dashboard-data.ts#L141-L164) route to properly handle user associations

### 3. API Client Updates
Updated the API client to properly pass user IDs:
- Modified [markNotificationRead](file://d:\ALL%20Data\eit_sms\src\hooks\use-dashboard-data.ts#L141-L164) to accept and pass user ID
- Updated all frontend components to pass user ID to API calls

### 4. Sample Data Enhancement
Added sample data for students and teachers tables:
- Added student record for the sample student user
- Added teacher record for the sample teacher user

## Testing Instructions

1. **Database Reset** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Drop and recreate the database
   dropdb edusync_db
   createdb edusync_db
   
   # Run the schema creation
   psql -d edusync_db -f sql/complete_database_setup.sql
   
   # Run the updated sample data script
   psql -d edusync_db -f sql/02_insert_sample_data.sql
   ```

2. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Start Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Login with Test Accounts**:
   - Super Admin: superadmin@edusync.com / password123
   - Admin: admin@edusync.com / password123
   - Teacher: teacher@edusync.com / password123
   - Student: student@edusync.com / password123

5. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Check that authentication works properly
   - Verify that dashboard loads without 400/500 errors
   - Check that notifications and events display correctly
   - Test marking notifications as read
   - Verify that different user roles see appropriate data

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:
- Authentication should work properly for all user roles
- Dashboard routes should return 200 status codes instead of 400/500
- Notifications and events should display real data from the database
- Users should only be able to access their own data
- No console errors should appear in the browser developer tools
