## Database Schema

### Events Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  event_type VARCHAR(100),
  color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#3b82f6',
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Notifications Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'info',
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  action_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### User Notifications Table (Many-to-Many)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  notification_id UUID REFERENCES notifications(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Role-Based Access Control

### Students
- Can view public events
- Can view events they created
- Receive notifications for relevant events

### Teachers
- Can view public events
- Can view events they created
- Can create new events
- Receive notifications for relevant events

### Admin Roles (admin, super-admin, principal, school-admin)
- Can view all events
- Can create, update, and delete any event
- Receive notifications for all events

### Other Roles (financial, library, labs, admission, club)
- Can view public events
- Can view events they created
- Receive notifications for relevant events

## Notification Workflow

1. When a new event is created:
   - A notification is generated with event details
   - The notification is linked to all relevant users
   - Users can see the notification in their dashboard

2. When a user views their notifications:
   - Unread notifications are displayed prominently
   - Users can mark notifications as read

3. Dashboard integration:
   - Recent events are displayed on the dashboard
   - Unread notification count is shown
   - Quick access to mark all notifications as read

## Testing Results

All functionality has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Event creation with automatic notifications
- ✅ Event retrieval and filtering
- ✅ Event updates
- ✅ Event deletion
- ✅ Notification creation and distribution
- ✅ Notification retrieval and marking as read
- ✅ Dashboard statistics and event display
- ✅ Role-based access control

## Integration with Frontend

The frontend API client has been updated to use the new Netlify functions:
- Calendar components can fetch and display events
- Dashboard components show notifications and event summaries
- Forms for creating and editing events
- Notification widgets with real-time updates

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**: Events and notifications are immediately visible to all relevant users
2. **Role-Based Access**: Users only see events relevant to their role
3. **Automatic Notifications**: Users are automatically notified of new events
4. **Centralized Management**: All calendar functionality is managed through Netlify Functions
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Serverless functions automatically scale with demand
6. **Cost-Effective**: No need for separate backend servers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Recurring Events**: Support for events that repeat on a schedule
2. **Event Reminders**: Automated reminders before events
3. **Calendar Sharing**: Ability to share specific events or calendars
4. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated event filtering options
5. **Export Functionality**: Export calendar events to other formats
6. **Integration with External Calendars**: Sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
